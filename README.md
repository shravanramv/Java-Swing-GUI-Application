The MMU online mini-project management system is a web-based application designed to assist MMU
lecturers and students with their mini-project assignments. It allows lecturers to upload, publish, and
manage mini-project content, while students can view and access projects that are relevant to their
program specialization. The system utilizes a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and includes
features such as user authentication, authorization, and data management.
Lecturers are provided with an account by the administrator, which they can use to upload and publish
projects to registered students. The projects are categorized according to student specialization and can
be modified later if necessary. Each project is assigned a unique ID for easy identification.
Students are also given a login username and password by the administrator. They can view the list of
projects offered by the associated lecturers in their view board, which is sorted by specialization. Only
students with the same specialization can view the projects. The lecturers can view all the projects they
are offering and assign/unassign students to their projects. One project can be assigned to a student
only. The lecturers can also activate/deactivate their projects to make them visible or hidden from the
students&#39; view board.
The administrator can create more administrator accounts, and all administrators can view and leave
comments on all the projects, and delete, or add projects. They can also view reports in terms of
● List of projects entered the system,
● List of projects according to specialization,
● List of projects according to lecturers,
● List of inactive projects,
● List of active projects,
● List of projects assigned to students,
● List of projects un-assigned to students,
● List of projects with comments.
In summary, the MMU online mini-project management system is a comprehensive web-based
application that enables lecturers and students to manage their mini-project assignments with ease. It
includes features such as user authentication and authorization, data management, and reporting, as
well as an intuitive user interface for easy navigation. This program will be a valuable tool for both
lecturers and students to manage their mini-project assignments effectively.
